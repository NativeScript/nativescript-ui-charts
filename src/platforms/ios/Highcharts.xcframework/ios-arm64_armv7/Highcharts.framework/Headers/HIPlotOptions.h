/**
Error bars are a graphical representation of the variability of data and are used on graphs to indicate the error, or uncertainty in a reported measurement. In TypeScript the `type` option must always be set. Configuration options for the series are given in three levels: 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the  `plotOptions.series` object. 2. Options for all `errorbar` series are defined in  `plotOptions.errorbar`. 3. Options for one single series are given in  `the series instance array`. ``` Highcharts.chart('container', {   plotOptions: {     series: {       // general options for all series     },     errorbar: {       // shared options for all errorbar series     }   },   series: [{     // specific options for this series instance     type: 'errorbar'   }] }); ```

Wind barbs are a convenient way to represent wind speed and direction in one graphical form. Wind direction is given by the stem direction, and wind speed by the number and shape of barbs. In TypeScript the `type` option must always be set. Configuration options for the series are given in three levels: 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the  `plotOptions.series` object. 2. Options for all `windbarb` series are defined in  `plotOptions.windbarb`. 3. Options for one single series are given in  `the series instance array`. ``` Highcharts.chart('container', {   plotOptions: {     series: {       // general options for all series     },     windbarb: {       // shared options for all windbarb series     }   },   series: [{     // specific options for this series instance     type: 'windbarb'   }] }); ```

A bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph. The bullet graph features a single measure, compares it to a target, and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance that could be set using `plotBands` on `yAxis`. In TypeScript the `type` option must always be set. Configuration options for the series are given in three levels: 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the  `plotOptions.series` object. 2. Options for all `bullet` series are defined in  `plotOptions.bullet`. 3. Options for one single series are given in  `the series instance array`. ``` Highcharts.chart('container', {   plotOptions: {     series: {       // general options for all series     },     bullet: {       // shared options for all bullet series     }   },   series: [{     // specific options for this series instance     type: 'bullet'   }] }); ```

An organization chart is a diagram that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions. In TypeScript the `type` option must always be set.
