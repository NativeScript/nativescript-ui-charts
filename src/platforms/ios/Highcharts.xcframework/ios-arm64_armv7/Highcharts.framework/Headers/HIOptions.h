Instead, colors are defined in CSS and applied either through series or point class names, or through the `chart.colorCount` option. ### Legacy In Highcharts 3.x, the default colors were: ```js colors: ['#2f7ed8', '#0d233a', '#8bbc21', '#910000', '#1aadce',     '#492970', '#f28f43', '#77a1e5', '#c42525', '#a6c96a'] ``` In Highcharts 2.x, the default colors were: ```js colors: ['#4572A7', '#AA4643', '#89A54E', '#80699B', '#3D96AE',     '#DB843D', '#92A8CD', '#A47D7C', '#B5CA92'] ```

A color axis for series. Visually, the color axis will appear as a gradient or as separate items inside the legend, depending on whether the axis is scalar or based on data classes. For supported color formats, see the [docs article about colors](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/colors). A scalar color axis is represented by a gradient. The colors either range between the `minColor` and the `maxColor`, or for more fine grained control the colors can be defined in `stops`. Often times, the color axis needs to be adjusted to get the right color spread for the data. In addition to stops, consider using a logarithmic `axis type`, or setting `min` and `max` to avoid the colors being determined by outliers. When `dataClasses` are used, the ranges are subdivided into separate classes like categories based on their values. This can be used for ranges between two values, but also for a true category. However, when your data is categorized, it may be as convenient to add each category to a separate series. Color axis does not work with: `sankey`, `sunburst`, `dependencywheel`, `networkgraph`, `wordcloud`, `venn`, `gauge` and `solidgauge` series types. Since v7.2.0 `colorAxis` can also be an array of options objects. See `the Axis object` for programmatic access to the axis.

Time options that can apply globally or to individual charts. These settings affect how `datetime` axes are laid out, how tooltips are formatted, how series `pointIntervalUnit` works and how the Highstock range selector handles time. The common use case is that all charts in the same Highcharts object share the same time settings, in which case the global settings are set using `setOptions`. ```js // Apply time settings globally Highcharts.setOptions({   time: {     timezone: 'Europe/London'   } }); // Apply time settings by instance var chart = Highcharts.chart('container', {   time: {     timezone: 'America/New_York'   },   series: [{     data: [1, 4, 3, 5]   }] }); // Use the Time object console.log(    'Current time in New York',    chart.time.dateFormat('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', Date.now()) ); ``` Since v6.0.5, the time options were moved from the `global` obect to the `time` object, and time options can be set on each individual chart.
