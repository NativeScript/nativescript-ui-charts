 A `venn` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
 
 Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.
 
 2. Options for all `venn` series are defined in `plotOptions.venn`.
 
 3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.

        },

Options for marker clusters, the concept of sampling the data values into larger blocks in order to ease readability and increase performance of the JavaScript charts. Note: marker clusters module is not working with `boost` and `draggable-points` modules. The marker clusters feature requires the marker-clusters.js file to be loaded, found in the modules directory of the download package, or online at `https://code.highcharts.com/modules/marker-clusters.js`.
