Options for the point markers of line-like series. Properties like `fillColor`, `lineColor` and `lineWidth` define the visual appearance of the markers. Other series types, like column series, don't have markers, but have visual options on the series level instead. In styled mode, the markers can be styled with the `.highcharts-point`, `.highcharts-point-hover` and `.highcharts-point-select` class names.

A predefined shape or symbol for the marker. When undefined, the symbol is pulled from options.symbols. Other possible values are `'circle'`, `'square'`,`'diamond'`, `'triangle'` and `'triangle-down'`. Additionally, the URL to a graphic can be given on this form: `'url(graphic.png)'`. Note that for the image to be applied to exported charts, its URL needs to be accessible by the export server. Custom callbacks for symbol path generation can also be added to `Highcharts.SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols`. The callback is then used by its method name, as shown in the demo.
