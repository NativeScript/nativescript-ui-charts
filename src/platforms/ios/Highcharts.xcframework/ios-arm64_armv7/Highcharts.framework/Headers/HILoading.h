The loading options control the appearance of the loading screen that covers the plot area on chart operations. This screen only appears after an explicit call to `chart.showLoading()`. It is a utility for developers to communicate to the end user that something is going on, for example while retrieving new data via an XHR connection. The "Loading..." text itself is not part of this configuration object, but part of the `lang` object.
