Set the animation for all drilldown animations. Animation of a drilldown occurs when drilling between a column point and a column series, or a pie slice and a full pie series. Drilldown can still be used between series and points of different types, but animation will not occur. The animation can either be set as a boolean or a configuration object. If `true`, it will use the 'swing' jQuery easing and a duration of 500 ms. If used as a configuration object, the following properties are supported: - `duration`: The duration of the animation in milliseconds. - `easing`: A string reference to an easing function set on the `Math`  object. See  [the easing demo](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/plotoptions/series-animation-easing/).
