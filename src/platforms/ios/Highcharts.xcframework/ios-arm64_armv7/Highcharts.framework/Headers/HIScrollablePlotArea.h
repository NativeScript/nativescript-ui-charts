/**
Options for a scrollable plot area. This feature provides a minimum size for the plot area of the chart. If the size gets smaller than this, typically on mobile devices, a native browser scrollbar is presented. This scrollbar provides smooth scrolling for the contents of the plot area, whereas the title, legend and unaffected axes are fixed. Since v7.1.2, a scrollable plot area can be defined for either horizontal or vertical scrolling, depending on whether the `minWidth` or `minHeight` option is set.

**Try it**

* [Scrollable plot area](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/chart/scrollable-plotarea)
* [Vertically scrollable plot area](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/chart/scrollable-plotarea-vertical)
