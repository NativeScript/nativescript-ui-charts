/**
Bindings definitions for custom HTML buttons. Each binding implements simple event-driven interface: - `className`: classname used to bind event to - `init`: initial event, fired on button click - `start`: fired on first click on a chart - `steps`: array of sequential events fired one after another on each  of users clicks - `end`: last event to be called after last step event
