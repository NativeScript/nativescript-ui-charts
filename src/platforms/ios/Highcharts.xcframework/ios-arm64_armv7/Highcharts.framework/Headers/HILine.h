/**
 A `line` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
 
 Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.
 
 2. Options for all `line` series are defined in `plotOptions.line`.
 
 3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.

    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        line: {
            // shared options for all line series

    },

        // specific options for this series instance
