Integration type. Available options are `'euler'` and `'verlet'`. Integration determines how forces are applied on particles. In Euler integration, force is applied direct as `newPosition += velocity;`. In Verlet integration, new position is based on a previous posittion without velocity: `newPosition += previousPosition - newPosition`. Note that different integrations give different results as forces are different. In Highcharts v7.0.x only `'euler'` integration was supported.

**Accepted values:** `["euler", "verlet"]`.
