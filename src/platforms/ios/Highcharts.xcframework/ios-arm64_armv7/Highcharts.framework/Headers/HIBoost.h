Set the series threshold for when the boost should kick in globally. Setting to e.g. 20 will cause the whole chart to enter boost mode if there are 20 or more series active.

Enable or disable pre-allocation of vertex buffers. Enabling this will make it so that the binary data arrays required for storing the series data will be allocated prior to transforming the data to a WebGL-compatible format. This saves a copy operation on the order of O(n) and so is significantly more performant. However, this is currently an experimental option, and may cause visual artifacts with some datasets. As such, care should be taken when using this setting to make sure that it doesn't cause any rendering glitches with the given use-case.
