How to interpret `levelSize.value`. - `percentage` gives a width relative to result of outer radius minus  inner radius. - `pixels` gives the ring a fixed width in pixels. - `weight` takes the remaining width after percentage and pixels, and  distributes it accross all "weighted" levels. The value relative to  the sum of all weights determines the width.

**Accepted values:** `["percentage", "pixels", "weight"]`.
