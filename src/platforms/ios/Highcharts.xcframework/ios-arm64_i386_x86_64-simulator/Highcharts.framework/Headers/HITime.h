/**
Time options that can apply globally or to individual charts. These settings affect how `datetime` axes are laid out, how tooltips are formatted, how series `pointIntervalUnit` works and how the Highstock range selector handles time. The common use case is that all charts in the same Highcharts object share the same time settings, in which case the global settings are set using `setOptions`. ```js // Apply time settings globally Highcharts.setOptions({   time: {     timezone: 'Europe/London'   } }); // Apply time settings by instance var chart = Highcharts.chart('container', {   time: {     timezone: 'America/New_York'   },   series: [{     data: [1, 4, 3, 5]   }] }); // Use the Time object console.log(    'Current time in New York',    chart.time.dateFormat('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', Date.now()) ); ``` Since v6.0.5, the time options were moved from the `global` obect to the `time` object, and time options can be set on each individual chart.

* [Set the timezone globally](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/time/timezone/)
* [Set the timezone per chart instance](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/time/individual/)

Whether to use UTC time for axis scaling, tickmark placement and time display in `Highcharts.dateFormat`.
