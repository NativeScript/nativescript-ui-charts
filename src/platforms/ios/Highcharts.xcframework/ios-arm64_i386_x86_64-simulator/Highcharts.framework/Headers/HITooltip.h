Callback function to format the text of the tooltip from scratch. In case of single or `shared` tooltips, a string should be returned. In case of `split` tooltips, it should return an array where the first item is the header, and subsequent items are mapped to the points. Return `false` to disable tooltip for a specific point on series. A subset of HTML is supported. Unless `useHTML` is true, the HTML of the tooltip is parsed and converted to SVG, therefore this isn't a complete HTML renderer. The following HTML tags are supported: `b`, `br`, `em`, `i`, `span`, `strong`. Spans can be styled with a `style` attribute, but only text-related CSS, that is shared with SVG, is handled. The available data in the formatter differ a bit depending on whether the tooltip is shared or split, or belongs to a single point. In a shared/split tooltip, all properties except `x`, which is common for all points, are kept in an array, `this.points`. Available data are: - **this.percentage (not shared) / **this.points[i].percentage (shared)**:  Stacked series and pies only. The point's percentage of the total. - **this.point (not shared) / this.points[i].point (shared)**:  The point object. The point name, if defined, is available through  `this.point.name`. - **this.points**:  In a shared tooltip, this is an array containing all other  properties for each point. - **this.series (not shared) / this.points[i].series (shared)**:  The series object. The series name is available through  `this.series.name`. - **this.total (not shared) / this.points[i].total (shared)**:  Stacked series only. The total value at this point's x value. - **this.x**:  The x value. This property is the same regardless of the tooltip  being shared or not. - **this.y (not shared) / this.points[i].y (shared)**:  The y value.
