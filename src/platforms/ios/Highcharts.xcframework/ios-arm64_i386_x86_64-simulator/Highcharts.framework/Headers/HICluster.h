Options for marker clusters, the concept of sampling the data values into larger blocks in order to ease readability and increase performance of the JavaScript charts. Note: marker clusters module is not working with `boost` and `draggable-points` modules. The marker clusters feature requires the marker-clusters.js file to be loaded, found in the modules directory of the download package, or online at `https://code.highcharts.com/modules/marker-clusters.js`.

**Try it**

* [Maps marker clusters](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/maps/marker-clusters/europe)
* [Scatter marker clusters](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/marker-clusters/basic)
