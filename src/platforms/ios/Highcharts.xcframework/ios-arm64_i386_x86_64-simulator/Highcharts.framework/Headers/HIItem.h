 A `item` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
 
 Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.
 
 2. Options for all `item` series are defined in `plotOptions.item`.
 
 3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.
