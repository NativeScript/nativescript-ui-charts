/**
The draggable-points module allows points to be moved around or modified in the chart. In addition to the options mentioned under the `dragDrop` API structure, the module fires three events, `point.dragStart`, `point.drag` and `point.drop`.

**Try it**

* [Draggable column and line series](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/dragdrop/resize-column)
* [Draggable bar](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/dragdrop/bar-series)
* [Draggable bubbles](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/dragdrop/drag-bubble)
* [Draggable X range series](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/dragdrop/drag-xrange)
