/**
The Data module provides a simplified interface for adding data to a chart from sources like CVS, HTML tables or grid views. See also the [tutorial article on the Data module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/working-with-data/data-module). It requires the `modules/data.js` file to be loaded. Please note that the default way of adding data in Highcharts, without the need of a module, is through the `series._type_.data` option.
