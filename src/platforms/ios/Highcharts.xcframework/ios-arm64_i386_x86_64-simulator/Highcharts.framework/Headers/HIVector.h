 A `vector` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
 
 Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.
 
 2. Options for all `vector` series are defined in `plotOptions.vector`.
 
 3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.

    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },

            // shared options for all vector series

Options for marker clusters, the concept of sampling the data values into larger blocks in order to ease readability and increase performance of the JavaScript charts. Note: marker clusters module is not working with `boost` and `draggable-points` modules.
