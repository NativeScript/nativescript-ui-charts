@interface HISeries: HIChartsJSONSerializable

/**
 An array of data points for the series. The points can be given in three ways:
 </br></br>1. An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will
 be interpreted as `y` values, and `x` values will be automatically calculated,
 either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from `pointStart`
 and `pointInterval` given in the plotOptions. If the axis is
 has categories, these will be used. This option is not available for range series. Example:
 <pre>
 data: [0, 5, 3, 5]
 </pre>
 </br>2. An array of arrays with two values. In this case, the first value is the
 `x` value and the second is the `y` value. If the first value is a string, it is
 applied as the name of the point, and the `x` value is incremented following
 the above rules. For range series, the arrays will be interpreted as `[x, low, high]`. In this cases, the `X` value can be skipped altogether to make use of `pointStart` and `pointRange`.
 Example:
 <pre>
 data: [
     [0, 9],
     [1, 2],
     [2, 8]
 ]
 </pre>
 </br>3. An array of objects with named values. In this case the objects are
 point configuration objects as seen below. Range series values are given by low and high.
 Example:
 <pre>
 data: [{
     x: 1,
     y: 9,
     name: "Point2",
     color: "#00FF00"
 }, {
     x: 1,
     y: 0,
     name: "Point1",
     color: "#FF00FF"
 }]
 </pre>Note that line series and derived types like spline and area, require data to be sorted by X because it interpolates mouse coordinates for the tooltip. Column and scatter series, where each point has its own mouse event, does not require sorting.

Possible values: `"on"`, `"between"`, `number`. In a column chart, when pointPlacement is `"on"`, the point will not create any padding of the X axis. In a polar column chart this means that the first column points directly north. If the pointPlacement is `"between"`, the columns will be laid out between ticks. This is useful for example for visualising an amount between two points in time or in a certain sector of a polar chart. Since Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric, where 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the previous, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the textual options, numeric point placement options won't affect axis padding. Note that pointPlacement needs a `pointRange` to work. For column series this is computed, but for line-type series it needs to be set. For the `xrange` series type and gantt charts, if the Y axis is a category axis, the `pointPlacement` applies to the Y axis rather than the (typically datetime) X axis.
