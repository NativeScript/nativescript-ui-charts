Defines how the title is repositioned according to the 3D chart orientation. - `'offset'`: Maintain a fixed horizontal/vertical distance from  the tick marks, despite the chart orientation.

This  looks nice, but hard to read if the text isn't forward-facing. - `'flap'`: Rotated text along the axis to compensate for the  chart orientation. This tries to maintain text as legible as  possible on all orientations. - `'ortho'`: Rotated text along the axis direction so that the  labels are orthogonal to the axis. This is very similar to  `'flap'`, but prevents skewing the labels (X and Y scaling are  still present). - `undefined`: Will use the config from `labels.position3d`
